        I’m passionate about tech, the environment, fitness and art. I’ve been
        instrumental in building a web design agency from the ground up but I’m
        seeking a new challenge.

        I’ve had diverse life experience as a former professional baseball
        player, a group fitness coach and a commercial actor. I’m a full circle
        communicator, team-oriented energy giver and a creative problem solver.
        I’m eager to take the next step in my software development career
        utilizing my previous work experience, leadership and teamwork
        abilities.
